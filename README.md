This repository contains some university related work I find interesting and worth noting. The repository contains the following:

1. Finding optimal Omega for SOR method in C (LAPACK,BLAS) : Short seminar implementing the search for optimal parameter for SOR method for linear system solving.
2. Homeworks : Few short homeworks related to PDEs and convex optimization.
3. Image denoising - short : Short notebook showing image denoising method motivated by variational formulation of a functional minimization problem.
4. Image restoring - short : Series of notebooks where I test various noising and denoising techniques for image restoration, along with convolution and deconvolution, such as motion blur and Wiener filter.
5. Implementation of Powell and Fletcher-Reeves optimization algorithms with few examples in MATLAB : Name is self explanatory.
6. SC1 (C) : Exercises from the course "Scientific Computing 1" where numerical methods for various different problems are applied, alongside interesting examples. Methods are implemented in C language along with LAPACK and BLAS packages.
7. SC2 (MATLAB) : Exercises from the course "Scientific Computing 2" where numerical methods for various different problems are applied, alongside interesting examples and visualizations. Methods are implemented in MATLAB.
8. Statistics : Two seminars made in the earlier stages of my studies, applying common data analysis for a statistics course. One was made individually and the other one in collaboration with three other students.
